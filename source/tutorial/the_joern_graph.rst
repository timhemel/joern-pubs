functions to CFG
CFG traversals

	-> repetitions (again): deal with cycles, simplePath
	will simplePath still work if the lead-up traversal already contains a cycle?

DFG traversals
ud and du links

function calls (intra vs interprocedural analysis)

repeating graph traversals, loops, and cyclic and simple paths.

closures for filters, maps and sideEffects

sacks

adding/changing/removing vertices, edges and properties.


developing queries and making unit tests, adding steps
debugging
revisit ast_traversals exercise 2: assure that the traversal is depth first, using println debugging. Then add emit and see what happens.
